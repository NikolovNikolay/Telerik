Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
I thought I'd take a ride
Laughing all the way
Bells on bob tails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to laugh and sing
The horse was lean and lank

Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Jingle bells, jingle bells
In a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
In a one horse open sleigh yeah
In a one horse open sleigh
